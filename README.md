# How to use

- Either download the .ahk file and execute it with Autohotkey 2+ or download [the binary from releases](https://github.com/bl00dshooter/lastepoch-autocast-tool/releases/latest).
- Change the hotkeys to match your ingame hotkeys and check the enabled box for the skills you wish to autocast.
- Close the window and switch to Last Epoch. Pressing the hotkey should now autocast the skill, just as if you were using numlock.
- To quit the program, right click its icon in your tray and select Exit.
- Select Options instead to reopen the configuration window if you wish to make changes to your hotkeys.
- The program will save your settings whenever you close the window, so you should only need to configure it once.

# FAQ

### Is this against the rules? Could I get banned for using it?

It is my understanding that this program complies with the game's rules, as per [Mike's post on the forums](https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/num-lock-and-third-party-software/19502/24). That said, I make no promises that you won't be banned. **Use it at your own risk**.
